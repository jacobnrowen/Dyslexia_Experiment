# Dyslexia_Experiment

This miniature experiment will be an attempt to determine what kinds of vowels are difficult to distinguish for people with dyslexia like my mother and sister. To do this, I will first record myself making vowel sounds in four particular ways:
  1) Bare vowel sounds with no consonants (e.g. \[i], \[u])
  2) Vowel sounds surrounded by the same consonants repeatedly (e.g. \[nini], \[nunu])
  3) Vowel sounds surrounded by varying consonants (e.g. \[divi], \[gulu])
  4) Vowel sounds in simple monosyllabic English words (e.g. "meat", "two")

After making and organizing these recordings, I will use the script I wrote to see how able my test subjects (and a control group) are to determine when a pair of audio samples contain the same vowel, and when they contain different vowels. The script should ensure a roughly 50-50 split to this end. These tests will be split into separate rounds for each type of recording. In the frist and second rounds, the subject will report whether they are hearing two different recordings of the same vowel, or two different vowels. In the third and fourth rounds, the surrounding consonants will be different in every recording.

Analyzing the data from all these tests should show what kinds of vowel sounds are hard to distinguish for these dyslexic listeners; of course, there's a lot of room for the different rounds to have different affects on the results, which I plan on analyzing as well. Best case scenario, I hope to find some kind of unifying trend in the formants of the confusing vowels; perhaps the dyslexic listener is sensitive to F1, but not F2, or perhaps they find it more challenging when the formants are closer to each other than when they're farther. No matter what, this experiment should leave me with a lot to analyze.
